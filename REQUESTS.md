## Welcome to the Planet's Core

First of all, thank you for considering helping me build my webpage. I have some very basic and rudimental knowledge of programming, but everything I want to do exceeds by far my skills.

As you will be able to read from the README, I downloaded this code from a FREE webpage that allows you to alter and use it to build your own site.

I thought it looked very nice and was responsive and very well laid out for me to have a strong start.

Below I will leave a list of the things I would like to add for now. I will explain every implementation as detailed as possible, in order to make it the easiest I can.

If you have any question, I am just one email away: fpl_secondmoonsbay@tutamail.com


## Implementations List

1. FIX VULNERABILITY ISSUES:

Upgrade minimist to version 1.2.3 or later. For example:

"dependencies": {
  "minimist": ">=1.2.3"
}
or…
"devDependencies": {
  "minimist": ">=1.2.3"
}
Always verify the validity and compatibility of suggestions with your codebase.

Details

CVE-2020-7598

high severity
Vulnerable versions: >= 1.0.0, < 1.2.3
Patched version: 1.2.3
minimist before 1.2.2 could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype using a "constructor" or "proto" payload.

2. SPANISH AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE OPTIONS:
    - I would like to add a Spanish version of the web.
    - The text I will add myself, but I would need to add the button and the option to change it.
    - Buttons should be called English and Español respectively.
    - I want the buttons to be right under the Welcome to nova main title.
    - The buttons should have the same format as the others on the page.
    - Users should be able to toggle between both languages very easily, in order to get the webpage in the desired one. 
    
3. BEGINNING CHAPTERS

    - Add the first 5 chapter of book online
    - Create page that derives from parent, called portal-to-nova
    - Create button under Book 1 image
    - Button text: Start Crossing
*ADDITIONAL: If a quick and simple animation of a portal generated on screen while loading the page could be made, that would be awesoome!

4. PROJECTS IMAGE BOX FIXING
    - As you can see, the box from the Send your character to Nova is bigger than the image.
    - I want that fixed so the box and the image stay together as it does on the top.
    - Basically I want the bottom aligned and not surpassing as you can see that happens.

5. FEATURED PROJECT 2
